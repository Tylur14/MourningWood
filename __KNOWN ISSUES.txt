ACTIVE ISSUES:

[Issues that can be detected in game]

 * Clunky scene transitions
 * Enemies can alert fellow Treemons through walls causing unintended behavoir and enemies moving through walls
 * Major auido balancing issues -- I.E. the Treemons taking damage sound effect is almost always drowned out by other SFX
 * Lack of enemy variety. Just one simple charge at player type
 * No tracking of information like 'time played in level' '% tracking for enemies killed, items picked up, or secrets found' etc...
 * No way to interact with options menu.
	|-> So technically there is an options menu but I wasn't able to get it implemented in time or elegantly.
	|->> Like the menu looks ugly and the options don't always stick? Will need to write seperate bug on that one day
 * Jukebox is 3D model and should be converted into sprites like the Treemons
 * Buttons do no have a texture

[Isses that are engine side]

 * All Door_B_(x) and Door_Secret_NoKey prefabs are not structured to permit elegant relative movements like other door prefabs.
	|-> These prefabs need the parent to be an empty, and the moved object to be a child of that empty. See other door
	|->> prefabs for example.
 * Door_B_NoKey, Door_Secret_NoKey, and TrapDoor do not have file icons making them hard to distinguish at a glance
 * All Door_Gate_(x) prefabs have the same or similar file icons making them hard to distinguish at a glance
 * Prefab TrapDoor does not follow naming convention of a door prefab
 * EndScene is just a whole bloody mess
